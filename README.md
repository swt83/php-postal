# Postal

A PHP package for working w/ postal addresses.

In working with US postal addresses, there seems to be no library out there that will help you standardize those addresses without having to use costly Geocoding API's.  This is my attempt to create my own standardizing library w/out the use of an API.

## Install

Normal install via Composer.

## Usage

```php
